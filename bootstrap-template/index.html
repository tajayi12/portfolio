    <p class="lead">
As a student at the University of Maryland, College Park, I am privileged to be a recipient of the prestigious Banneker Key merit-based full scholarship and a member of the University Honors program, a component of the universityâ€™s Honors College. Within University Honors I am able to live and learn with other Honors students while taking specialized courses that explore topics of enduring and contemporary significance from the perspectives of different academic disciplines and methodological orientation.
<br>
<br>
In the past years, I've participated in numerous sales, marketing, and public relations activities. Working at a local boutique and being an active member of multiple organizations, I have enhanced my digital marketing, communication, and interpersonal skills. I have also developed my ability to lead a team and increase community engagement as former VP of Operations and current President of the Gamma Mu chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta. While I have gained invaluable sales and marketing experience, and my interpersonal skills have led me to pursuing a degree in Broadcast Journalism with minors in Spanish and Law & Society.
<br>
<br>
My major in Broadcast Journalism allows me to utilize many skills I have learned in previous jobs, while opening my horizons to many of the pressing issues that challenge our society. By supplementing my degree with minors in Law and Society and Spanish, I hope to enter the journalism field with thorough knowledge of politics and law as well as understanding of other cultures and how societal issues affect marginalized populations. I believe that my outgoing personality and love for public speaking will help me to pursue one of my most important life principles: To use my platform for others.</p>
